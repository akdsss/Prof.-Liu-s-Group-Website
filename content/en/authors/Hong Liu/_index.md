  <div class="text-biography">
    <font face="Times New Roman,宋体">Prof. Hong Liu’s research interest focuses on the mesoscopic behavior of the reactive polymer systems, as well as the topological regulation of mechanical interlocked polymers. Prof. Liu had developed a coarse-grained simulation strategy coupled with the polymerization reaction model, which had been applied by others including international renowned scholars for many times. His work has established the multi-scale theoretical and simulation study framework of the structure and dynamics of macromolecular systems mediated by microscopic molecular reactions. Till now, more than 100 peer-reviewed papers have been published on the journals like Science, Macromolecules, etc. Prof. Liu has undertaken 4 NSFC projects acting as the project leader, including a National Excellent Youth Fund of NSFC.</font>
