abstract: "Using dissipative particle dynamics simulation combined with our stochastic reaction model, we delve into the mechanisms and controlling factors of self-assembled structures formed by the solvophilic/solvophobic chain-grafted patchy nanoparticles via the polymerization-induced self-assembly strategy, i.‚Äçe., PISA. The results indicate that PISA exhibits unique advantages in controlling the morphology of assemblies compared to conventional self-assembly methods. Furthermore, the packing fraction of nanoparticles significantly affects the morphologies obtained by PISA, with the self-assembled structures evolving from simple spherical micelles to complex layered network structures as the nanoparticle's packing fraction increases. Finally, based on the analysis of the phase diagram, we predict the formation tendencies of different self-assembled structures under specific conditions. This study investigates the factors that influence the formation of different assembly morphologies of patchy nanoparticles. These results are expected to provide theoretical guidance for the experimental synthesis and industrial production of nanocomposites with a variety of morphologies."
